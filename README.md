# forms.css

Consistent forms across all major browsers. [Demo.](http://frncs.co/forms/demo.html)

## Unstyled elements

Some elements (like `input[type='file']` and `input[type='range']`) are just to hard to manage. I left those out.

## Things to note

* This is a work in progress.
* I’ll try to extend the browser support.
* CSS documentation will be extended step by step.

## Browser support

* Chrome 16+
* Firefox 9+
* IE 9+
* Opera 11+
* Safari 5+
