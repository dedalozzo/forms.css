# forms.css

Consistent looking forms across all major browsers. Check out the [demo](http://frncs.co/forms/demo.html) and read through the [CSS file](https://github.com/isellsoap/forms.css/blob/master/assets/css/forms.css).

## How to use it

Include the `forms.css` file in your web project and change it to your needs.

## Unstyled elements

Some elements (like `input[type='file']` and `input[type='range']`) are just to hard to manage. I left those out.

## Things to note

* This is a work in progress.
* I’ll try to extend the browser support.
* CSS documentation will be enhanced step by step.

## Browser support

* Chrome 16+
* Firefox 9+
* IE 9+
* Opera 11+
* Safari 5+
