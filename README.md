## How to use it

* Rip the code apart, change it according to your needs, customize it!

## Things to keep in mind

* This is a work in progress.
* I’ll try to extend the browser support. Yes, IE 8, I’m looking at you!
* I completely go along with the makers of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) when they say about their project that it *is not intended to be a mysterious ‘black box’ that is included in a project and then ignored. It should be used as a customisable starting point on any project*. This applies also to forms.css.
* Elements like `input[type='file']` and `input[type='range']` are just to hard to manage or not manageable at all. I left those out.
* CSS documentation will be enhanced step by step.

* To be continued …
