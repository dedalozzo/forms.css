# forms.css

Consistent forms across all major browsers.

---

My way of “teaching your forms some manners”. Obviously massively inspired by [Nathan Smith](http://sonspring.com/)’s awesome [formalize](https://github.com/nathansmith/formalize).

## Browser support

* Chrome 16+
* Firefox 9+
* IE 9+
* Opera 11+
* Safari 5+

## Unstyled elements

* input[type='file']
* input[type='range']

Some elements are just to hard to manage. I left those out.

## Ignored elements

* input[type='hidden']
* input[type='image']

## Things to note

* This is a work in progress.
* I’ll try to extend the browser support.
* CSS documentation will be extended step by step.
