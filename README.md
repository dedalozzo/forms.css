# forms.css

Consistent looking forms across all major browsers. Check out the [demo](http://isellsoap.github.com/forms.css/demo.html).

## How to use it

* Simply include the `forms.css` file in your web project and change it to your needs.
* Read carefully through the heavily documented [CSS file](https://github.com/isellsoap/forms.css/blob/master/assets/css/forms.css) and learn form it.
* Help me and [file issues](https://github.com/isellsoap/forms.css/issues).

## Things to note

* This is a work in progress.
* Some elements (like `input[type='file']` and `input[type='range']`) are just to hard to manage or not manageable at all. I left those out.
* I’ll try to extend the browser support.
* CSS documentation will be enhanced step by step.

## Browser support

* Chrome 16+
* Firefox 9+
* IE 9+
* Opera 11+
* Safari 5+
